We used solana ide to create a pizza transaction system between customers and vendors on the solana blockchain. We started off by creating a simple account by the name of: ‘transaction’. We also created functions to interact with the ‘transaction’ account. Namely, create_transaction, join_transaction, order and start_transaction. 

Given the AI prompt by solana-ide, we were able to use v0 to provide us a skeleton of our program. Once we had the project output, we created the project following instructions on ChatGPT. We set up our environment locally and used VS Code to run tests. We followed the recommended file structure and file creation from ChatGPT. After some debugging, package installing/updating, conversations with Hieu we were able to get tests up and running. 

We were able to get the tests running using on my local net. But we had to spin up a local test validator to simulate the blockchain on my PC with one node in it. The test process already involved deploying.
